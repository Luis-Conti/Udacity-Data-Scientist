# Disaster Response Pipeline
## Project motivation
The purpose of this project is to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. Those messages can be, for example, tweets sent during a natural disaster such as earthquakes or hurricanes. A machine learning pipeline will categorize these messages so that they can be sent to the appropriate disaster relief agency.


## Attached files
This repository contains the following files:
* A copy of the original datasets:
  ** [disaster_messages.csv](disaster_messages.csv): contains original messages sent during disasters. 
  ** [disaster_categories.csv](disaster_categories.csv): contains a classification of the beforehand mentioned messages.
* A [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Luis-Conti/Udacity-Data-Scientist/blob/main/Data-Science-Blog-Post/Singapore%20apartment%20resale%20prices%20analysis.ipynb), which contains the Python code that was used for this project. The code makes use of the following Python libraries: 
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * scipy
  * sklearn

## Conclusions
Findings and conclusions from this analysis are presented in this [Medium post](https://luis-conti-gz.medium.com/singapore-apartment-resale-prices-analysis-1105770b3015). 
Summarizing:
* Singapore Central Area has the highest apartment resale prices per square meter.
* Several features affect the price of the apartment: size, location, floor level, apartment type, apartment model and, to a lesser extent, lease commence date.
* The multiple lineal model built in Python showed a very good performance and robustness at estimating the resale price of an apartment in Singapore given some characteristics.

## 1. Data science blog post
In this project, the resale price of apartments in the city-state of Singapore was analyzed. The analyzed dataset, in .csv format, is one of the documents available in this repository.

The original data set, along with many others, can be downloaded from the [Singapore Government website](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices?resource_id=42ff9cfe-abe5-4b54-beda-c88f9bb438ee). 

A thoroughful analysis of this dataset, making use of different Python libraries, was performed in the attached Jypiter Notebook . file. The following Python libraries were used for this project:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scipy
* sklearn

Findings and conclusions from this analyzed are presented in this Github post. The aim of this post is to provide answers to the following questions:
* 1- Which is the district of Singapore with higher average apartment resale price per square meter?
* 2- Apart from the district, which other features significantly affect the resale price?
* 3- Which is a reasonable resale price for an apartment in Singapore with specific characteristics?

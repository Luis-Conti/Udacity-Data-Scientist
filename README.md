This repository was created to host the files I created for the different projects of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.
## 1. Data science blog post
In this project, the resale prices of apartments in the city-state of Singapore were analyzed. The dataset used for this purpose is one of the documents available in this repository and can be found [here](SG_prices.csv).

The original data set, along with many others, can be downloaded from the [Singaporean Government website](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices?resource_id=42ff9cfe-abe5-4b54-beda-c88f9bb438ee). 

A thoroughful analysis of this dataset, making use of different Python libraries, was performed in the attached [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Luis-Conti/Udacity-Data-Scientist/blob/main/Singapore%20apartment%20resale%20prices%20analysis.ipynb). The following Python libraries were used for this project:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scipy
* sklearn

Findings and conclusions from this analysis are presented in this [Medium post](https://luis-conti-gz.medium.com/singapore-apartment-resale-prices-analysis-1105770b3015). The aim of this publication is to provide answers to the following questions:
* 1- Which is the district of Singapore with the highest average apartment resale price per square meter?
* 2- Apart from the district, which other features significantly affect the resale price?
* 3- Which is a reasonable resale price for an apartment in Singapore with specific characteristics?

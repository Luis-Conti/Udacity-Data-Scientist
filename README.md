# Udacity-Data-Scientist
This repository was created to host the files I created for the different projects of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.
## 1. Data science blog post
In this project, the resale prices of apartments in the city-state of Singapore were analyzed. Go to this [repository](https://github.com/Luis-Conti/Udacity-Data-Scientist/blob/main/Data-Science-Blog-Post) for more information.
## 2. Disaster Response Pipeline
This portfolio includes a combination of ETL and ML Pipelies for the categorization of messages (texts). Results are shown in a web app.
Files that were used for such purpose, as well as the instructions to run the web app, can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/Luis-Conti/Udacity-Data-Scientist/blob/main/Disaster-Response-Pipeline).

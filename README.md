# Udacity-Data-Scientist
This repository was created to host the files I created for the different projects of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.
## 1. Data science blog post
In this project, the resale prices of apartments in the city-state of Singapore were analyzed. Go to this [repository](https://github.com/Luis-Conti/Udacity-Data-Scientist/blob/main/Data-Science-Blog-Post) for more information.
## 2. Disaster Response Pipeline
This portfolio includes a combination of ETL and ML Pipelies for the categorization of messages (texts). Results are shown in a web app.
Files that were used for such purpose, as well as the instructions to run the web app, can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/Luis-Conti/Udacity-Data-Scientist/blob/main/Disaster-Response-Pipeline).
## 3. Recommendation Engines with IBM
Interactions between user and articles on IBM Watson Studion platform have been analyzed. Based on this analysis, different recommendation engines have been developed in order to provide users recommendations on articles they will likely be interested in. Code and further details are available in this [repository](https://github.com/Luis-Conti/Udacity-Data-Scientist/blob/main/Recommendation-Engines-IBM).
## 4. Turbofan Health Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance
This is the capstone project of this Data Scientist Nanodegree. Machine learning models are created to carry out predictive maintenance on turbofan engines based on sensor measurements. Please find more information in this [repository](https://github.com/Luis-Conti/Udacity-Data-Scientist/tree/main/Turbofan-Predictive-Maintenance).
